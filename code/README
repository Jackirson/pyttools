The toolbox actually consists of two parts:

I)  The functions designed to perform the basic Pytyev's Possibility Theory (pt)
operations. Note that it's correct to say "possibility theory", not "theory of
possibility".

II) The functions designed to evaluate technologies under uncertainty.
Generally speaking these functions can be used to evaluate not only technologies,
but everything a decision maker wants to evaluate. So let's call this problem
simply "evaluation".

I think these parts have to be separated. Let's do it the following way:

1. Put the functions from different groups (I and II) to separate directories:
   "possibility" for basic possibility theory functions (group I), and
   "evaluation" for group II.

2. Use prefix "pt" for the function from group I and "ev" for group II.

3. Put a loader.sce script to both "possibility" and "evaluation" directories.

4. Put to the root directory a loader.sce script executing both
   possibility/loader.sce and evaluation/loader.sce.
